I worked in the Research, Development & Innovation (RSI) department of Arethusa Srl. I participated in the implementation of three Research Projects financed by the Campania Region and MISE: ReASSET, DIGGERly and CADS.
In the DIGGERly and CADS projects I have mainly been involved in the development of Android applications, using Kotlin (XML layout and Jetpack Compose) and Dart (Flutter).
In the ReASSET project, I dedicated myself to the integration of blockchain technology, helping to design and implement innovative solutions based on this architecture.
For all these projects I contributed to:
• Development of web, desktop and mobile software using different programming languages/platforms/technologies;
• Collaboration with development and design teams to ensure product quality;

A smart APP, user friendly and eco-sustainable, which allows you to “capture” with a simple smartphone, asset components construction and plant engineering, in the necessary space of time of one “walk” to locate assets of interest in a building.
The main features of DIGGERly are shown below:
1) Quick Asset Detection & Inventory Assessment: Quick detection of assets and inventory valuation (technical records); digitally tracing the scenarios, the state of affairs, the consistency of real estate assets (architectural, construction, industrial and plant engineering).
2) Smart Asset Data Collection & Reporting: collection and reporting smart Asset Data (Specialized Knowledge Base for sector); technical and illustrative documentation such as: site inspection certificates, asset mapping, technical records, update and compliance checks.
3) Asset Performance (Status) - Tracking & Compliance Reporting: periodic monitoring of asset performance (status) e comparison and compliance reporting.

REASSET project has the aim, as an innovative product-service, of satisfying the increasingly critical need in Italy in the context of Global Maintenance Service services, which is to make maintenance services qualitatively and economically more sustainable of real estate and plant assets.
The  project concerns the conception, study, design and prototype implementation of a MaaS (Maintenance as a Service) technological platform, as a new product/service based on a collaborative and innovative organizational maintenance model, aimed at eliminating everything that does not produce value in the management of services.
REASSET platform uses the integrated Blockchain-IoT paradigms for the interoperable and transparent sharing of authenticated and protected data and information, regarding the valorization and real-time operational management of technical-plant assets and technical-economic transactions relating to the interactions between the different subjects involved in the entire Facility Management supply chain.
The platform involves the development of a cloud web architecture for the development of MaaS (Maintenance as a Service) services, with the integration of Blockchain and IoT technologies and paradigms, the development of Predictive Maintenance processing processes through the acquisition in real time of signals from industrial sensors (e.g. temperature, voltage, current, vibrations, noise, etc.) for the field collection of data on the functionality of Assets.

In CADS, the DIGENS application was developed with the purpose of creating a tool for rapid detection, recording and qualitative-quantitative evaluation of the state of consistency and danger of non-structural elements (ENS), in their context (location), in the case of seismic events and important stresses.
The need to be met with DIGENS was to facilitate and increase the productivity of inspections (for the same amount of time) for the detection of the vulnerability of ENS in health areas, so as to encourage as much as possible the restoration of the seismic performances of the ENS themselves.
The app, through the use of multimedia tools and technologies for capturing reality (photos, films, voice notes, localization, etc.), allows to acquire the data on the seismic classification characteristics of the geographical location (where a property of interest is located) and the intrinsic and installation characteristics (seismic vulnerability) of each of the different ENS that are part of it. The final assessment of the possible level of related danger follows, taking into account, for example, the possible and simultaneous constant presence of people who could be affected by insufficient performance of ENS.
The app returns the final descriptive and visual report of the ENS detected, ordered by level of seismic danger, estimating the intervention priorities for restoration and performance improvement.

I started by developing Progressive Web Apps (PWA) using JavaScript and TypeScript, with React.js for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. Later, I specialized in developing Android applications using Kotlin, building several apps with traditional XML layouts and later adopting Jetpack Compose to create more modern and dynamic interfaces. I then expanded my skill set by incorporating the Dart language and the Flutter framework, with which I am currently developing applications. This allows me to create high-quality cross-platform solutions, with modern and responsive interfaces, optimizing development with a single codebase for multiple platforms.';
